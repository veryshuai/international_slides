        \begin{itemize}
            \item Government consumption (ex: military)

\end{itemize}

\frame{
\frametitle{National Product vs. National Income}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Capital depreciation like a reduction in the wealth of owners of capital 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Needs to be subtracted from production to get income 
        \item GNP net of depreciation is called Net National Product (NNP)
    \end{itemize}
    \item Unilateral transfers
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Sometimes a country gives goods or services to another country
        \item Needs to be added to production to get national income
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
}

\frame{
\frametitle{Gross Domestic Product}
\begin{itemize}
    \item GDP has replaced GNP as the most common headline figure in national accounts 
    \item Only one difference
    \begin{itemize}
        \item GDP is the product of all factors in a country, regardless of the owners 
        \item GNP is the product of all factors owned by people from a country, regardless of production location
    \end{itemize}
    \item Ex: If a British firm owns a factory in Denmark
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The product is part of Denmarks GDP, but not GNP
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\frametitle{More on the Current Account}
\begin{center}
$CA = EX - IM  = Y-  \left(C + I + G \right)$
\end{center}
When production > domestic expenditure, exports > imports: current account > 0 and trade balance > 0
\begin{itemize}
\item if $Y> \left(C + I + G \right) \Rightarrow EX > IM \Rightarrow CA>0$ (surplus)
 \item if $Y< \left(C + I + G \right) \Rightarrow EX < IM \Rightarrow CA<0$ (deficit)
\end{itemize}
World production must equal world consumption, investment, and government purchases
\begin{itemize}
\item Globally, deficits and surpluses must balance
\item Some countries often borrowers, others often lenders: \textbf{global imbalances}

\frametitle{National Saving}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Define national savings as:
\begin{equation*}

\end{equation*}
    \item GNP identity:
\begin{equation*}
        Y =  C + I + G + CA
\end{equation*} 
    \item Combine the two:
\begin{equation*}
 \implies       S - CA =  I
\end{equation*}
    \item Investment can be financed by:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Putting off consumption (pay today)
        \item Borrowing from abroad (pay tomorrow)
        \item Current account sometimes called \emph{net foreign investment}

$S=S^{p} + S^{g}$

\frame{
\frametitle{National Saving: Private vs government}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Combining our two definitions of saving:
\begin{equation*}
    S = I + CA = S^{p} + S^{g}
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
    S^{p} = I + CA - S^g 
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
    S^{p} = I + CA + \left(G - T\right)

    \end{enumerate}
    \item A \emph{Financial Asset} holds wealth: stocks, bonds, debt, etc
    \item current account + financial account + capital account = 0
    \begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{current account}:  tracks flows of goods and services (imports and exports)
\item \textbf{financial account}:  tracks flows of financial assets (financial capital)

% \begin{itemize}
% \item \textbf{Exchange rate crises} occur when a currency experiences a sudden decrease in value against another currency.
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Such crises are fairly common – 19 crises 1980-2002
% \end{itemize}
% \item Crises can have severe economic consequences.
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Government default
% \item Financial and banking collapses
% \item Severe contraction in output and decline in real wages
% \end{itemize}
% \item Politically embarrassing
% \begin{itemize}
% \item Countries experiencing crises often seek help from international development agencies, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

% Factors that influence the return on assets determine the demand of those assets.
% \begin{itemize}
% \item \textbf{Rate of return:} the \% change in value that an asset offers during a time period
% \item \textbf{Real rate of return:} inflation-adjusted rate of return
% \item if inflation=0 $\Rightarrow$ rate of return=real rate of return
% \end{itemize}

% Example:
% Should we invest in a Danish bond or an Euro bond?
% \begin{itemize}
% \item 1 DKK in DK bonds $\Rightarrow \left(1+R_{DKK,t}\right)$ DKK in a year
% \item 1 DKK in Euro bonds: $\Rightarrow \left(\frac{1}{E_{DKK/EURO,t}}\right)\left(1+R_{EURO,t}\right)$
% \item at time $t+1$: $\Rightarrow E^{e}_{DKK/EURO,
% t+1}\left(\frac{1}{E_{DKK/EURO,t}}\right)\left(1+R_{EURO,t}\right)$
% \item No arbitrage: the two returns have to be equal
% \end{itemize}

% 
% \frame{
% \frametitle{The Uncovered Interest Parity (1)}
% We can rewrite the relation as:
% \begin{center}
% $\left(1+R_{DKK,t}\right)=E^{e}_{DKK/EURO,t+1}\left(\frac{1}{E_{DKK/EURO,t}}\right)\left(1+R_{EURO,t}\right)$
% \end{center}
% \begin{center}
% $\Rightarrow$
% \end{center}
% \begin{center}
% $\left(1+R_{DKK,t}\right)=\left(1+R_{EURO,t}\right)\left(\frac{E^{e}_{DKK/EURO,t+1}}{E_{DKK/EURO,t}}\right)$
% \end{center}
% Taking logs,
% \begin{center}
% $R_{DKK,t}\approx R_{EURO,t}+\left(\frac{E^{e}_{DKK/EURO,t+1}-E_{DKK/EURO,t}}{E_{DKK/EURO,t}}\right)$

% \begin{itemize}
